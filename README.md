i have used mongo db for database nodejs express bcrypt for password hashing and json web tokens for authentication and sessions ,
i have made a secrets app that consists of basic registering and loggin in and saves user credentials in mongo db.
after logging in you share a secret and you can see other's secrets too since its a secret sharing website.
you can delete secrets too but only the secrets you have posted and i have implemented a nocache function so that browser does not present any protected data after logging out even for a moment.
